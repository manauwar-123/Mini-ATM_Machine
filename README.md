# Mini-ATM_Machine
This is my mini java project which performs basic function of ATM Machine like Withdraw, Transfer, Transaction History, Deposit.
HEllo This is MD Manauwar, i am a learning java for android Development . I have tried a basic project which replicates the basic functions of Atm Machine . 
Main.java is the file which we need to Run , rest are the classes which are called in the main function . 

To Run this code you need A jdk and an ide any is preferable , you can also try to run the code in the cloud Development environment like Riplet and OnlineGDB.
If you have any new ideas or you find a bug report it in the issue section

THANK YOU>
